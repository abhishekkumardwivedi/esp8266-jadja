This is a smart MQTT client for ESP8266 with the following features:
 - On the first boot an open WiFi network and HTTP server are launched. The user joins the network and 
   configures the credentials for his home Wifi network. After that ESP8266 restarts and works as MQTT client,
 - On each next boot ESP8266 tried to connect to the home WiFi network with the configured credentials and 
   to MQTT brokwer through the Internet connection,
 - The user can reset the configations at any time by holding GPIO0 to low for 5 seconds.
 
This project is based on the open source projecs: esp-httpd and esp_mqtt.
